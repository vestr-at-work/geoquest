# GeoQuest üó∫Ô∏è
GeoQuest is a mobile game that gives you the oportunity to complete story quests, find treasures and earn EXPs in the real world!
Think Geocaching with multipart immersive story lines based on real world history events tailored to the quest location so that you are connected to the surrounding area even more.
While enjoying the story you are also learning interesting history trivia along the way.

The creation of the quests will also be open to the players so you can create your own quests in your neighbourhood to let others participate in interesting local stories!

# How to play
Sounds cool, but "how can i play?" you ask?

Right now the game is in the development :(, but I would love to hear what do you have to say about the concept!
