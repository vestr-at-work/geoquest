# GeoQuest üó∫Ô∏è
GeoQuest is a mobile game that gives you the oportunity to complete story quests, find treasures and earn EXPs in the real world!
Think Geocaching with multipart immersive story lines based on real world history events tailored to the quest location so that you are connected to the surrounding area even more.
While enjoying the story you are also learning interesting history trivia along the way.

The creation of the quests will also be open to the players so you can create your own quests in your neighbourhood to let others participate in interesting local stories!

# üß≠ How to play
Sounds cool, but how can I play? you ask?

Right now the game is very much at the beginning of the development, but we would love to hear what do you have to say about the concept! 
You can share your ideas with the developers in the discussions here: https://github.com/vestr-at-work/geoquest/discussions/7

## Help testing! (or how to run)
If you can't wait to play the game and you want to help test it, your help is very much appreciated! Here how you can try it out.

The game is developed in a cross-platform environment called NativeScript so you will have to install it first.
Guide on how to do just that for Linux, Windows or Mac here: https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/

You can run `tns` to check if everything is working. 

Then you need to clone this repsitory using either https
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vestr-at-work/geoquest.git
```
or ssh.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:vestr-at-work/geoquest.git
```

Now in the `/geoquest` folder run the following to install all the needed modules.
```shell
npm install
```

And finally you can run
```shell
ns run android
```
or 
```shell
ns run ios
```
with your phone connected or emulator setup.

Let us know in the Issues or Discusions what you think!
